						<h2>Joyous</h2>
						<p></p>
						<p>Joyous, is a behavioral healthcare company, whose goal is accessible and affordable mental health services.</p>
						<p><span class="fragment">Challenge: Scale to a growing number of patients while staying lean and efficient.</span></p>
						<aside class="notes">
						In the dynamic world of behavioral healthcare, Joyous faced a significant hurdle:
						How to provide personalized and easily accessible mental health services to a growing number of patients with a lean and efficient team.
						
						Traditionally, gathering and acting upon patient data was a slow and cumbersome process, often relying on manual analysis of medical surveys. 
						Joyous aimed for more, envisioning a future where care was tailored to each individual's unique needs, drawing insights from their messages, journal entries, and other text-based interactions.
						To achieve this vision without getting bogged down in complex coding and lengthy development cycles. This is where **Squid AI** stepped in as a **catalyst for innovation**.

						**Squid AI's platform proved to be remarkably easy to use and configure**, allowing Joyous to **quickly connect to their existing systems out of the box** and access relevant data. Instead of months or years of development, Joyous could now **build and deploy AI agents in a matter of days**. These AI agents began acting as **personal healthcare assistants** for patients, shifting Joyous's development approach from traditional coding to **AI-driven protocols** that were more directly informed by the team closest to the patients.

						The **Squid AI assistant** became instrumental in helping Joyous **manage their growing suite of AI tools and chatbots efficiently**. The user-friendly interface allowed for swift updates and adjustments without requiring additional coding expertise. This meant that healthcare providers and technicians could directly contribute to the platform, bridging the gap between medical knowledge and technical implementation.

						The impact was transformative. **Squid AI enabled Joyous to automate personalized healthcare**, leveraging their own data to deliver value to their clients rapidly. By providing easy access to Joyous's vast knowledge base, care providers could deliver more informed and effective personalized care. The result was a **tenfold increase in information turnaround speed and accuracy**, directly benefiting the patients.
